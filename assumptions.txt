========== Assumptions =====================

1. The error messages used are dummy and will not be shown to the user.

2. Filter of Flight details from mock Airlines Service response is based on origin and destination airport parameter.

3. If any expection occers it will be automicaticlly handle in API controller.

4. There can still be lot of junit test cases written. In the interest of time, I wrote only few.

5. Last but not least, there are still improvement required in Validation and Exception Handling
   which can be future enhancement.
